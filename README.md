# PuzzleSkills

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/puzzle/skills.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/puzzle/skills)

PuzzleSkills is a open source webapplication for skill management. Users can manage their profiles and CVs with PuzzleSkills. We are working on additional skill management features.

## Back-End

The Back-End is built with Ruby on Rails with an API interface.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [RVM](http://rvm.io/)
* PostgreSQL

### Development

* `git clone https://github.com/puzzle/skills.git`
* `cd skills`
* `rvm install 2.5`
* `rvm use 2.5`
* `gem install bundler`
* `sudo apt-get install libpq-dev`
* `sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev `
* `bundle install`

#### database setup

##### Docker

* Install docker and docker-compose https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/
* `cd $project_git_dir` and `docker-compose up -d`

##### Classic

* `sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib`
* `sudo su - postgres`
* `createuser puzzlecv -s -l -P` (with password puzzlecv)
* type `exit`

go back to skills repo
* `rails db:setup`

now run backend server
* `rails s`

#### Testing

* To run the backend tests run `rake spec`
* Frontend tests can be executed with `rake spec:frontend`
* Frontend tests with livereload `rake spec:frontend:serve`
* To run a single test run the following command in the frontend folder `npm test --filter "some filter words"`
* There is also `rake ci` and `rake ci:nightly` which should be periodically exectued by a build job (e.g. on jenkins)

#### Definition of Done (DoD) for new Code / Features

* implementation (inclusive correspondent frontend and backend tests)
* `rake spec` passes
* `rake spec:frontend` passes
* `rake rubocop` passes
* manual testing (start server, frontend and click through the new feature)
* peer review
* remove obsolete code

#### Entity Relationship Diagram
* run `bundle exec erd` to create the current ERD

### LDAP config

The following environment variables are required for using ldap:

| Umgebungsvariable | Beschreibung | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LDAP_BASENAME | LDAP Base name, e.g. ou=users,dc=yourdomain,dc=com  | - |
| LDAP_HOSTNAME | LDAP Server host name | - |
| LDAP_PORT | LDAP Server Port | 686 |

### Enable Authentication in development

Set the Environment variable ENABLE_AUTH to true in backend.

### Managing Roles
Roles can't be updated, created or deleted through the UI. For this you must use the rails console.
* Enter the root folder and type `rails c`
* Establish the connection to the table: `Role.connection`
* Use `Role.create`, `Role.update` or `Role.delete` for your desired action.

Exact documentation for these methods can be found [here](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html#crud-reading-and-writing-data)

### Managing Categories
Categories can be added using the [skill_config.yml](https://github.com/puzzle/skills/blob/master/config/skill_config.yml) file.

But they can't be removed or updated this way. They have to be updated/deleted manually like the roles above.

## Front-End

The Front-End is built with EmberJS.

See [frontend/README.md](https://github.com/puzzle/skills/blob/master/frontend/README.md)
