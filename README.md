# Disclaimer

We are currently rewriting the application and completely removing EmberJS.
The new Techstack will solely rely on Rails and some Hotwire/Stimulus.
Therefore, the documentation below is not accurate anymore and will be rewritten soon.

If you still need the old state you can find the last release [here](https://github.com/puzzle/skills/releases/tag/v4.4.1).
The EmberJS-based Application will no longer be maintained.

However, we intend to provide the same functionality in the new Tech Stack without any fundamental data changes.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer:

-   [Git (Version Control System)](http://git-scm.com/)
-   [RVM (Ruby Version Manager)](https://rvm.io/) ([installation](https://rvm.io/rvm/install) requires `curl` and `gpg`)
-   Either [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) or [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for the Database (Docker is recommended)

## Openshift deployment
To deploy the project to openshift make sure you set the following environment variables:
- LOCAL=false
- client_id: 
- secret: 
- host_url: 
- realm: 
- admin_role: (Not required)

## Setup dockerized Application👩🏽‍💻
We're glad you want to setup your machine for PuzzleSkills development 💃

### Windows users
If you're on Windows you should be able to Download Ubuntu from Microsoft Store. Note that you need to enable Subsystem for Linux and virtual machine platform in your Windows features.  
Then you can open Ubuntu and follow the manual using the Ubuntu console.  
When you finished use your Windows IDE and open the skills folder that's located in your Linux subsystem -> Ubuntu and start developing.  
If this doesn't work you can always use a VM.

First you need to clone this repository:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/git/ && cd ~/git/
git clone https://github.com/puzzle/skills.git && cd ~/git/skills
```

⚡ If your user id is not 1000 (run id -u to check), you need to export this as env variable: **export UID=$UID** before running any of the further commands. Maybe you want to add this to your bashrc.

## Start Development Containers

**Without Keycloak (recommended)**
Since this is the default, you don't have to do anything and can run all commands inside the root of the project.

**With Keycloak**
To use the application with Keycloak, navigate to `config/docker/keycloak` and run all commands from this directory.
You can log in either as `user` or as `admin`. The password for both accounts is `password`.


### Start application
To start the PuzzleSkills application, run the following commands in your shell:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

⚡ This will also install all required gems and seed the database, which takes some time to complete if it's executed the first time. You can follow the progress using `docker logs -f rails` (exit with Ctrl+C).

After the startup has completed (once you see `Listening on http://0.0.0.0:3000` in the logs), make sure all services are up and running:

```bash
docker ps
```

This should look something like this:

```
IMAGE              COMMAND                   PORTS                                       NAMES
ruby:3.2           "/bin/bash -c '\n apt…"                                               assets
skills-dev/rails   "rails-entrypoint ra…"    0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp, :::3000->3000/tcp   rails
postgres:16        "docker-entrypoint.s…"    0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp, :::5432->5432/tcp   postgres
```

Access the web application by browser: http://localhost:3000 and enjoy the ride!

## Debugging
To interact with `pry` inside a controller, you have to attach to the container first using `docker attach rails`.
This will show you any **new** logs, and if you encounter a `pry` prompt, you can interact with it.
To detach from the container without stopping it, press `CTRL + p` then `CTRL + q`.


## Testing

-   To run the backend tests run `rake spec`
-   Frontend tests can be executed with `rake spec:frontend`
-   Frontend tests with livereload `rake spec:frontend:serve`
-   To run a single test run the following command in the frontend folder `npm test --filter "some filter words"`
-   There is also `rake ci` and `rake ci:nightly` which should be periodically exectued by a build job (e.g. on jenkins)
-   To use a user without admin privileges change email in `app/controllers/application_controller.rb#authenticate_auth_user"` to "user@skills.ch"
